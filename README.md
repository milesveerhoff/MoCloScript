This script uses the two tables that can be exported from a benchling construct as csvs. After running assembly_main.py, it prompts the user to select each of the files, and provides them with settings for the reaction. After running, it will save a python file which can be imported directly into the opentrons app. Any further specific tweaks to the protocol should be done on this saved script. The default thermocycler protocol is based on https://wiki.rice.edu/confluence/display/BIODESIGN/Golden+Gate+Assembly.
